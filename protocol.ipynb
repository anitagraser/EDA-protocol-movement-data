Missing data may indicate issues with the data collection process or the data export used to generate the analysis dataset. At this early stage, we usually start with raw location records that have yet to be aggregated into trajectories. Therefore, initial analyses look at elementary position records. The following protocol steps target issues of missing data with respect to movement data's spatial, temporal, and attribute dimensions. \n",

    "This step addresses the question if the dataset covers the expected spatial extent. This can be as simple as checking the minimum and maximum coordinate values of the raw records. However, it is not uncommon to encounter spurious location records or outliers that are not representative of the actual covered extent. These outliers may be truly erroneous positions but can also be correct positions that happen to be located outside the usual extent. Looking at elementary position records only, it is usually not possible to distinguish these two cases. It is therefore necessary to take note of these outliers and investigate further in later steps.\n",

    "Unexpected spatial extent can have different consequences, depending on whether the extent is too small, too large or covering a wrong area. If the area of interest to the analyst's work is not covered, it may be necessary to go back to the data collection phase. If the extent is larger than expected, it can cause excessive processing run times. For example, if the dataset is to be rasterized with a fixed target raster cell size, an unexpected large extent will result in a larger than expected raster. Additionally, any outliers that exceed the valid coordinate ranges, for example, for latitude and longitude values, should inform the analyst to proceed with caution and stay alert regarding other potential data quality issues. \n",

    "Classic scatter plots (or point maps) are helpful at this step. Point density maps (often called heat maps) on their default settings tend to hide outliers and are therefore not recommended.

Similar to exploring the spatial extent, the obvious step is to determine the minimum and maximum timestamps first. Since GPS tracking requires accurate clocks to function, time information on the tracker is usually reliable. However, it is not guaranteed that these timestamps make it through the whole data collection and (pre)processing chain leading up to the exploratory analysis. For example, in some cases, tracker (or sender) time is replaced by receiver or storage time. Thus clock errors on the receiving or storage devices can result in unexpected timestamps.\n",

    "Undiscovered timestamp issues can affect the derived temporal extent, as well as all other temporal and spatiotemporal analyses. A typical problem (especially when working with CSV data sources) is erroneous parsing of dates, for example, switching the digits for day and month when they cannot be inferred unambiguously. This leads to wrong temporal assignments, such as records from Feb, 3rd being assigned to March, 2nd.
